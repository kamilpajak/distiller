# Project Brief: Distiller

## Overview
The Distiller project is an automated distillation control system implemented on an Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 board. The system is designed to automate and optimize the distillation process, ensuring consistent quality and yield of the distilled product.

## Core Requirements

1. **Automated Process Control**
   - Fully automate the distillation process from heating the mash to collecting different fractions
   - Maintain precise temperature control throughout the process
   - Manage flow rates for optimal distillation

2. **Fraction Collection**
   - Separate and collect different fractions (foreshots, heads, hearts, tails) automatically
   - Measure the volume/weight of each fraction
   - Control valves to direct the appropriate fraction to the correct container

3. **Monitoring and Feedback**
   - Monitor temperatures at multiple points in the system
   - Track the weight/volume of collected fractions
   - Display real-time information about the process

4. **Safety Features**
   - Prevent overheating
   - Ensure proper coolant flow
   - Implement emergency shutdown procedures

## Goals

1. **Consistency**: Produce consistent results across multiple distillation runs
2. **Efficiency**: Optimize the distillation process for maximum yield and quality
3. **Automation**: Minimize the need for manual intervention during the distillation process
4. **Precision**: Accurately control temperatures, flow rates, and fraction collection
5. **Reliability**: Ensure the system operates reliably over extended periods

## Scope

The system controls:
- Heating elements (3 power levels)
- Coolant flow
- Main distillate flow
- 6 separate fraction collection valves
- Temperature monitoring at 4 points
- Weight measurement for 6 collection containers

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully automate the entire distillation process
2. Accurately separate and collect different fractions
3. Maintain temperature stability within defined parameters
4. Achieve consistent results across multiple runs
5. Provide clear, real-time information about the process
